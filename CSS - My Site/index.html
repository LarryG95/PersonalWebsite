          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>I learned to program at 19 years old when enrolled at Texas State University, and have been in love with the sport ever since! Starting with Object oriented design, to data structures & algorithms, and now using all I've learned to work my hand at full-stack web development.</p>

          <h3>Hardwork & Good Fun</h3>
          <p>Growing up I've always taken good pride in my work ethic and integrity as a young individual. That doesn't mean I'm all work and no play however. Having more hobbies than I can keep up with, my weekends end up being just as busy as my weekdays. From Golfing 18 holes, to kayaking when the weather is right. The most important part of life is making time for the things you love and sharing a laugh with those around you.</p>
